# Auto-ML-

### The goal of this project
    1) Automate the machine learning process
    2) Applicable for small datasets
    3) Deploy the project
    4) Test on the real time data
### 1) Automate the machine learning process
        This project is used to build to over come some of the commonly used steps in Machine Learning. The user has to only enter the necessary fields. It takes very less time rather than re writting the steps every time.
  
### 2) Applicable for small datasets
        You can upload any structured data. This means the datasets which you want immediate results and take less computational power are applicable.
        
### 3) Deploy the project
        The project is deployed using Heroku platform, which is easy to deploy and integrate.
    
### 4) Test on the real time data
        After completing training and testing on the data. THey you can apply your real time data for immediate results.
